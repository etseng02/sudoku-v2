2. Shows user the next number and solves sudoku sequentially.
3. Adds a toast to let user know that running the solving algorithm was completed or errored out.

2. Clone repo
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run dev`


## Limitations
1. Cannot run on lower node versions.
2. Cannot solve much harder sudokus.
